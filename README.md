I do not guarantee that notebooks will run flawlessly in your enviroment and I strongly suggest if you want to run the notebooks in the same enviroment to create a new one (python 3.9 or 3.10 I cannot remember right now which worked in my case but start with 3.9)  and then install numpy, keras, matplotlib, pandas, seaborn with this order having in mind that you should not upgrade anything after installing keras.

I will be open for comments and possibly questions. Enjoy!
